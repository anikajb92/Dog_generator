# Dog_generator
Hackstreet {boiz} as four-legged pups

# Storyboard (Deliverables): 
- Home page will have all dog-ID cards listed (with just name and picture)
  - Cards should be clickable to go into the more detailed listing/page (expandable OR new page if expanding is too tricky)
- If user does not find their name on the list, they can add their dog profile: 
  - image URL
  - name
  - nickname
  - favorite treat

# Advanced Deliverables:
- Home page search bar: user should be able to find their name on the list, or SEARCH for their name 
  - When they search: their own dog identity card should show up with additional info (like favorite treat)
  
# Pseudo-code:
- Identify what the input value should be and then match that to the profile ID card
  - POST will automatically set up an ID
